Problems found with Rev E:
1) The SW_BTN needs to be a slide switch
2) The WAKEUP and RST buttons are hard to reach and require considerable pressure to press. Consider changing to lighter buttons that are larger. Not sure where to move them though.
3) P2_0, should have series 4.7K resistor to center pin of high/low block
4) P2_4, should have series 4.7K resistor to center pin of high/low block
5) EAN, should have 10 ohm resistor to center pin of high/low block
6) (maybe?) Make P2_0, P2_4 and EAN avaialble (through jumpers) to chipKIT I/O pins
7) The P0_4 and P1_5 are indicator pins and should be brought out to LEDs (with current limiting resistors or not?)
8) SW_BTN and WAKEUP may or may not be needed, - check with Raghu.
